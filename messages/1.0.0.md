v1.0.0 (2014-08-28)
-------------------

- The settings management for executable paths has been changed!
  If you depend on this, you'll have to revisit.
- Added support for stylus! (an example file has been bundled as well)

- If running a pre-compiler, the compiled result will always be shown if there
  was an error parsing it
- Added commands to create a new csscheme file (or variation) based on templates
- Added command palette entries to open the readme and settings files
- DumpErrors now show the same debug output as ParseErrors
- Fixed long relative path references in some situations (mainly stylus)
- Fixed wrong syntax file reference with `"preview_compiled_css": true`
- SASScheme files now also get a dedicated syntax which allows CSScheme to more
  accurately match its build system (same for stylus). This relies on the
  external "Sass" package.
- Fixed wrong line number being displayed when an at-rule was encountered
  multiple times
- Added punctuation scopes to auto completion (csscheme, scsscheme)


The 0.3.0 release is a bit older, but I forgot to make PC show the update
message, so it's included here as well:

v0.3.0 (2014-03-08)
-------------------

- Differentiate between style and options list ("fontStyle" vs e.g.
  "tagsOptions") for validation (also #2)
- Allow `"fontStyle": none;` for empty style list (#4)
- Highlight SASS's `index` function
- Fix not showing error message if a line number was not found from the
  compiled SCSS (within the last x lines)
- Added snippets for `@for`, `@each`, `@else if`, `@else`, `@while`
- All "package" related files were moved to a sub-directory
